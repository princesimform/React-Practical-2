## About Practical Components

---

<br />

- Components Structure

```
App (Functional Component)
  - Layout (Statelass Component)
      - Header (Class Component , Stateless Component)
      - TodoList (Functional Component)
          - TodoItem (Functional Component)
      - AddTodo (Functional Component)
```

- Class Component

  - In React, class components are JavaScript classes that extend the React.Component base class. Class components are used to define a component that can have its own state, lifecycle methods, and event handlers.

- Functional Component

  - In React, functional components are a simpler way to define a component than using a class. A functional component is a plain JavaScript function that takes in props and returns JSX. They are also known as "stateless" or "presentational" components because they don't have any internal state or lifecycle methods.

- Statelass Components
  - a stateless component is another term for functional components, which are plain JavaScript functions that take in props and return JSX. Stateless components are also called "presentational" or "dumb" components because they don't have any internal state or lifecycle methods.
